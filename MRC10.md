# Smart Agents Tools/Marketplace with staking capabilities. 

## 1. Problem

The Morpheus ecosystem currently lacks a robust Non-Fungible Agent (NFA) framework, advanced tools for integrating NFA-linked Smart Agents, a marketplace for trading them, and a platform for strategic staking/investment in those smart agents by the Morpheus community. These gaps limit Smart Agents' operational capabilities and market liquidity, hindering the development of a thriving Tools/Agent marketplace.

## 2. Proposed Solution

We propose a comprehensive suite of solutions, including:

1. An NFA Framework for creating and managing Smart Agents
2. Smart Agent Advanced Tools for integrating with external data sources, APIs, and oracles
3. A Smart Agent Marketplace for trading and managing Smart Agents 
4. A Smart Agent Investment Platform for staking MOR tokens into Smart Agents

### 2.1 Solution Overview

An end-to-end ecosystem enhancement offering a full lifecycle approach for Smart Agents — from creation, integration, and trade to investment and governance.

### 2.2 Delivery Strategy 

The project will be delivered in four distinct phases, each with its own set of deliverables. We will leverage smart contracts, APIs, Web3 technologies (Solidity, Web3.js/ethers.js, WebSockets), Python, IPFS, and DEX pools for token bonding and liquidity provisioning.

## 3. End Result

A fully operational and integrated suite of services that boosts Smart Agents' usability, liquidity, and value within the Morpheus ecosystem, driving individual project success and overall ecosystem growth.

## 4. Value Proposition

The advanced integration tools will significantly augment the usability and functionality of NFA-linked Smart Agents, enabling seamless interactions with external platforms and services. This broadens Smart Agents' operational scope and application potential, allowing them to perform more complex tasks across blockchain and web environments.

By enabling MOR holders to stake into specific Smart Agents, we enhance the MOR token's intrinsic value while empowering Smart Agents with expanded capabilities. The improved utility and versatility of Smart Agents will attract new users and developers, driving the ecosystem's scalability, sustainability, and growth.

## 5. Reference Implementations

The enhancement will primarily involve the development and utilization of "Smart Agents, Tools & Examples".

## 6. Dependencies

None. We can start work immediately without depending on existing MRCs.

## 7. Weights Requested

Considering the scale and impact, we request a total of [X] weights.

## 8. Existing Weights

We are not aware of any existing weights granted for the proposed deliverables.

## 9. Timeline

The project is expected to take at least 6 months, with each of the four components being developed sequentially over 3-month phases.

## 10. Deliverables

1. **NFA Framework**: A standardized technical framework for creating and managing Smart Agents, with Agentic ABI, trackable ownership via AINs, staking mechanisms for risk mitigation, and robust security protocols.

2. **Smart Agent Tools**: Integration tools enabling sophisticated interaction with external data sources, APIs, and decentralized oracles, using Web3.js/ethers.js libraries and WebSocket communication.

3. **Smart Agent Marketplace**: A trading and management platform with an intuitive interface, advanced search and filters, and a community-driven ratings system.

4. **Smart Agent Investment Platform**: A strategic investment platform allowing MOR holders to stake MOR into Smart Agents, influencing MOR reward distribution and providing decentralized governance with aligned ecosystem interests.

### 11. Why you?

Mor Labs is composed of individuals with extensive experience in DeFI, smart contract development, marketplace business model design, making us the ideal candidate to deliver this proposal.
