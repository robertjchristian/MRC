# Building Decentralized AI

On December 9, 2023 the Decentralized AI community assembled from around the world at Kiretsu in Austin, Texas in order to begin contributing to this repository.

The objectives are to define
    1. The tech stack
    2. Practical technical standards for collaboration within in the community

Morpheus encourages and will incentivize developers who propose or implement new standards/integrations between open source projects in DeAI.

Live Journal

## Morpheus - David A. Johnston

Morpheus is designed to incentivize the first peer-to-peer network of personal AIs, known as Smart Agents. Providing users open-source Smart Agents to connect to their wallets, Dapps, & smart contracts promises to open the world of Web3 to everyone.

## Anna Zazlauskas - Vana

Vana: Own your data

***Key points***

- data ownership
- goal: world where users own data and value it creates
- initial belief: token incentives enable large scale RLHF and data labelling
  - people who want to sell data do so out of desperation
  - not the best dataset
  - uphill fraud battle
  - people constantly finding ways to sell bad data
  - people who want to sell data for financial reward are not representative
  - mostly doing out of financial desperation
  - users choose products that align with ideologies, value privacy and agency
- Reality:
  - users choose whatever is most convenient or capable. privacy/security are afterthoughts.
  - slacktivism

- initial belief: data ownership legislation like GDPR and CCP will help.
  - regulation favors consumers.
- learning: even if users have a legal right ot data, it is inconvenient to access. users have to be very motivated.
  - regulation favors incumbent.

- you can ask for your labels on instagram

- On Vana:
  - make a personal data tangible through a personalized ai model
  - bring your model with you throughout internet
  - users host their own nodes or opt for a convenient hosted option
  - private data stays on user's node, while third party apps run inference.
  - granular permissions so you can let people access your data or models.

- Modalities:
  - image: train lora based on 10 photos of yourself
  - text: personality + memory stream from your social data and messages
  - audio( hosted) based on 1min of your voice
  - best audio models are closed source (?)

- memory architecture
  - query memories based on relevance, important, and recency
  - summarize relevant memories to fit in context window
  - for more, read Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior

- bootstrapped network by building viral consumer applications in house
  - 1.2M users
  - 700k private models trained
  - 10M personal data points

- collective models
  - users contribute data to models they collectively own and govern
  - users decide who can access the model, how much to charge, how it can be used
  - each collective has its own node, similar to a user’s node

- host your own vana node
  - connect your social data, journal entries, messages, other personal data with an ally that deeply understand you
  - everything stays on yoru machine
  - can open up an endpoint to use it throughout apps
  - reach out to <anna@vana.com> to try this out

## Ritual - Niraj

Integrate AI models into your protocol, application or smart contract with a few lines of code.

Described a global statistical computer.

__Key Points:__
- motivation:
    - ai is eating the world
    - usage going up massively
    - decentralized intelligence improving

*problems of AI today:*
- infrastructure highly centralized
    - model storage
    - model governance and ownership (e.g. OAI fiasco)
    - model compute (training, inference, fine tuning, etc)
    - access to training data
- ai infra is highly permissioned
    - high costs ot using/improving AI
    - permissioned centralized APIs to access
    - no privacy/computational integrity censorship resistance
    - most OSS models are highly red-teamed/censored
    - many geographical limitations
- AI infra is increasingly regulated
    - ai incumbents and governments attempting strong regulatory capture
    - “we know what’s in your best interests”

- future impact
    - as AI gets inserted into every tech product, new forms of censorship/manipulation ill take place
    - LLMs and other foundation models create highly engaging forms of propaganda (e.g. 2024 US election media)
    - political ideology weaponized by who controls distribution and access to models
    - open and transparent governance of AI models is key
    - “who controls models controls the world”

*AI x Crypto to the rescue*
- AI is highly centralizing tech
- crypto is highly decentralizing tech
- combining both solves aforementioned problems
- trustlessness + intelligence = ???won’t be evil -> can’t b evil
- if we’ve decentralized money, music, property records, etc, why not AI?

At Ritual:
- how do we get AI into hands of crypto devs today
- combine best of ai and crypto to make it easy for devs to build crypto x ai products
- model specific computational integrity (opML and zkmlO
- privacy (FHE for classical ML models, MPC for foundation models)
- ritual AI VM with stateful precompiles for various model operations (inference, FT, quantization, embeddings)
- supports Ethereum base chain and rollups, alt L1 support coming in 2024

- tech pillars
    - censorship resistance and decentralization
    - privacy
    - computational integrity
    - incentives

- infernet: network for inference
    - take smart contract, plug into model
    - allows you to customize infra
    - set up nodes yourself, run inference for your products

- frenrug
    - on-chain smart agent that buys and sells friend.tech keys if you can convince it
    - built on internet SDKs
    - internet llm nodes generate responses, feeds into on-chain classifier (with ezkl proof)github.com/frenrug/contracts

FreedomGPT

- SmarterChild: conversational AI
- robot you could talk to on AOL IM when no one was there
	- pretty dumb
	- step above a Liza
	- you could make your own, have it talk to other people, look at conversations
	- sometimes it would say “i’m not going to answer that”
	- chilling effect
	- happening again now

- sold mutual mobile a year ago
- 400 person a year go making dgitial products for f1000
- did a lot with AI
- sold it, started playing with ChatGPT about a year ago
- had birthday party for chatgpt last week
- a year ago decided to create FreedomGPT
- app store for AI
- first model: trying to get to parity of ChatGPT using Luna, 3d gradient descent
- model would answer anything
- 2 million people trying it out

- as capability increase, censorship and prohibition increase

- as capability increases, privacy and liberty decreases don’t use it if you’re not sure things will remain private

- they will make it illegal to access under penalty of death (treason)

- midjourney bans Xi, Jinping

--------

- technology is what allows freedom to exist
- belief: freedom is assured by documents
- reality” freedom assured by access to sufficiently advanced knowledge & technology over  
- those wanting ot take your freedom away

- these are munitions we need them otherwise they will be used against us and they already are

- fall of Constantinople by ottoman empire - gunpowder

- Gutenberg printing press caused nation to fall and US became independent

- war of 1812, attacked library of congress where books were

- those that start by burning books, will end by burning men heinrich heine

- how much more powerful is AI than books? 10x?1000x?

- thought experiment
	- imagine an AI that people star tto trust nearly 100% of the time

	- the problem isn’t if AI says something incorrect it’s as if AI starts saying too many correct things

	- e.g. “ted cdruz is zodiac killer”
   
- our predictions
	- ai public/private censorship timeline

	- 18 months (may 2025) accessing many AIs in the US will be on par with 		
- pharmaceutical RXs (if you can prove you need it, you can access)
	- 24 months, powerful AIs will require a process similar to obtaining a firearm with background checks and waiting periods. 
	- misuse will result in permanent revocation. numerous AIs will be banned from being indexed in search engine or even mentioned by the AIs that re deemed “publicly safe”

- Within 36 months, access to most powerful AIs will be restricted

- decentralizing freedom of compute because there is no other option

### Upshot - Nick Evans

- Upshot: AI Network optimzied for financial applications
- powered by proof opf alpha protocol
- reward people by how useful for financial markets

- why focus on financial pplications?
	- build tools that can enable creation fo financial markets for anything
	- riskless society
	- efficient enough markest that every risk can be hedged
	- cryp is olargely financial innovation
	- financialization has been one of main usec ases
	- more conducive for trustless/verifiable form factors

- bacgkground
	- upshot one: peer prediction protocol for incentivizing honest responses to subjective questions
	- DMI Mcehanism:
	- dominantly truthful: truth tellling is dominant strategy
	- informed ftruthful: truth telling is  stricftly better than uinformative strategies
	- detail free: does not require prior knowledge to be inputted by mechanism designer
	- constant: only a constant number of questions and agents are required for it to be both dominantly truthful and informed-truthful

- findings
	- peer prediction doe simprove truth teslling incentives
	- network of human eactors lacks accuracy and scalability

- Upshot AI x Crypto Tooling
	- AI infrastructure for price predictions, network analyses, yield strategies, etc.
	- 2-5% MAPE (mean absolute percentage error)
	- 394m assets supported
	- <5 min update cadence
- findings
	- validated hypothesis around demand for AI x crypto systems
	- single entity creating models introduces scalability constraints and security rsisk

- solution
	- combine peer prediction protocol and AI x Crypto infra to build decentralized AI network optimized for financial applications

Upshot:
	- alpha miners establish contractual agreements on chain with dat providers
	- results in rev sharing from alpha minor work
	- share predictions with each other regularly
	- score each other’s predictions, leveraging peer prediction mechanism
	- incentivize them to share evaluations honestly

- big graph broken by topics
	- topic is defined by objective that is being collaoratively solved
	- output: mmeta model
	- data providers establish edges with alpha providers
	- alpha minors share predictions with each other, score predictions, scores aggregated, rewards distributed based on proof of alpha

- zkPredictor
	- alpha minors can pass around proofs verifying output of their work is result of underlying model they’re advertising
	- ensures tamper proof models
	- zkSNARK proof system optimized for tree-based models
	- verifies output of initial models on upshot network approaching 10k predictions per hour

Robonet:
- fist application that builds on Upshot and zkPredictor
- DeFi vaults with AI-Powered Yield Strategies
- smart contracts are limited compute environments
- AI is better at making sense of large amounts of data

	1. users deposit capital into robonet vaults.
	2. 2 strategies are instantiated as “optics” on upshot network
	3. upshot
	4. fees are shared between upshot peers contributing to the strategies and capital providers

- people who have unique insights no longer need capital or structure to profit off insights

- benefits
	- more diverse, expressive strategies
	- support for more long tail categories
	- cryptographically verified models
	- potential for much higher yield

##Pannel Discussion
#### Ryan @ Modulus Labs
- previously AI research at Stanford
- worked in tech finance stuff
- decentralization promise and power of AI was so cool
- modulus is leading company crafting zero knowledge proofs for ML inference

#### Ben @ Gensyn
- machine learning compute protocol
- provide ability for anyone with ML capable compute device to offer that device to anyone in the world to train AI model
- pure hardware incentives
- previously ML researcher

#### Casey
- ML work at google as engineer
- partner at Paradigm

- most important now?
- smart contracts can’t harness power of AI
- missing key functionality that web2 has which is power of AI
- bc AI models are huge
- billions of parameters, gigaflops to teraflops of compute to perform
- gas cost on L2s cost 10s of thousands to millions to run single inference in trustless manner
- zero knowledge proof
- proof cf correct computation
