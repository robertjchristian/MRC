# Morpheus Multi-Agent Framework (MMAF)
## Executive Summary

# This MRC has been CLOSED
## Comments: Thank you for the MRC11 submission.
Moving this MRC11 to CLOSED status.

Morpheus' core is to develop incentivization for agent and model builders while allowing permissionless access. 
There isn't a desire to promote any particular framework. Pragmatically speaking, a dev would choose whichever frameworks and tech stack they see fit to build the level of desired functionality. They would then use the Morpheus system to host model assets/definitions and provide inference for users. There isn't a path here to promote particular frameworks.

**Project Name:** Morpheus Multi-Agent Framework (MMAF)  
**Requesting Organization/Individual:** Mor Labs

The MMAF project aims to evolve the Morpheus ecosystem from a single-agent system to a sophisticated multi-agent framework. By leveraging the CrewAI codebase, this initiative will enable the development and coordination of multiple smart agents, facilitating diverse functionalities and inter-agent communication. This expansion is poised to significantly enhance the adoption, versatility, and operational efficiency of Morpheus Smart Agents, fostering a new level of dynamic interaction within the decentralized space.

## Introduction
Mor Labs, in collaboration with the CrewAI community, proposes to spearhead the development of a multi-agent framework for Morpheus. Our team combines Mor Labs' deep expertise in decentralized technologies with CrewAI's pioneering work in AI and multi-agent systems. The collaboration is uniquely positioned to execute this ambitious project, given our proven track record in blockchain development, AI, and community-driven innovation.

### Problem Statement
Currently, Morpheus operates with a single-agent paradigm, limiting its capability to handle complex, multi-dimensional tasks that require collaboration or competition among agents. This restriction hampers the potential for scalability, flexibility, and efficiency in achieving sophisticated decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contract orchestration.

### Project Objectives
Develop Multi-Agent Capabilities: Enable the creation and coordination of multiple smart agents within the Morpheus ecosystem.

### Foster Agent Interoperability: Ensure smart agents can interact seamlessly with agents created by third parties.
Enhance System Productivity and Adoption: By introducing multi-agent functionality, significantly improve the productivity of the Morpheus ecosystem and its appeal to developers and users.
Demonstrate Multi-Agent Use Cases: Implement and showcase practical use cases of multi-agent systems within Morpheus.

### Proposed Solution
Our solution involves developing a comprehensive multi-agent framework that allows for the creation, management, and interaction of multiple smart agents within the Morpheus ecosystem. This framework will leverage the existing CrewAI codebase, enhancing it with blockchain-specific functionalities to support decentralized operations. Agents will be able to communicate, collaborate, and negotiate with each other, enabling complex decentralized processes and applications.

### Technology Stack
Base Codebase: CrewAI for agent algorithms and behaviors.  
Blockchain Integration: Solidity for smart contract development, with Morpheus and Ethereum blockchains as primary platforms.  
Communication Protocols: Development of decentralized communication protocols for agent interaction.  
Security: Implementation of security best practices and protocols to ensure the integrity and privacy of multi-agent interactions.  

## Implementation Plan
### Preparation and Community Engagement 
Finalize the proposal with community feedback. Gather initial feedback from the Morpheus and CrewAI communities to refine the project's direction. 
Conduct a detailed requirement analysis for the multi-agent framework. Identify specific functionalities, interoperability requirements, and security protocols needed.

### Framework Design and Prototype Development
Design the multi-agent framework's architecture. This includes defining the communication protocols, agent management systems, and integration points with the Morpheus ecosystem.
Develop a prototype of the multi-agent functionalities using the CrewAI codebase. Focus on core capabilities that demonstrate the framework's potential.

### Integration and Initial Agent Development
Integrate the prototype framework with the Morpheus ecosystem. Ensure the initial setup is ready for agent development.
Develop initial smart agents within the framework. Prioritize agents that showcase interoperability and the potential for complex decentralized applications.

### Testing, Refinement, and Security Enhancement
Conduct comprehensive testing of the multi-agent framework and initial agents. Identify and address any interoperability issues.
Refine the framework and agent functionalities based on testing outcomes. Enhance system security protocols. 

### Launch and Community Demonstration
Officially launch the multi-agent framework. Ensure all systems are operational and fully integrated with the Morpheus ecosystem.
Conduct demonstrations of multi-agent use cases. Host community workshops to engage developers and users, encouraging adoption and feedback.
